## Equity Resources
Equity work is an on-going journey where I am learning more everyday. My goal is to help bring others on my journey so that together we can create a more just world.

Gathered here are materials that I have developed for various audiences.

## My goal guiding Equity work is to:
1. Help develop a sense of understanding of the world beyond ourselves and our own story.
1. Create an understanding that we are all humans with flaws and challenges, but that some people have experienced ongoing, systemic oppression that needs to be acknowledged,  interrupted, and dismantled.
1. Facilitate the development of crucial conversations and critical thinking.
1. Encourage the practice of growth in creating equitable and accessible structures and programs for all people.
